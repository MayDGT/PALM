### Core inputs
# Path to mission YAML used by `ScenarioState` and `MCTS`.
# This path is resolved relative to the project root.
mission_yaml: "data/case_studies/mission2.yaml"

# Total number of MCTS iterations (total simulations allowed)
budget: 200

# Parent folder to store generated test artifacts (yaml, ulg, png)
tests_folder: "/data/results/"

### Scenario hyperparameters
# Maximum number of obstacles allowed in a scenario before it is considered terminal
max_obstacles: 3

### MCTS hyperparameters
# UCB1 exploration constant (higher favors exploration)
exploration_rate: 0.70710678  # ~ 1 / sqrt(2)

# Progressive widening: scaling constant (C) and exponent (alpha)
C: 0.5
alpha: 0.5

# Progressive widening: per-layer widening multipliers
C_list: [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]
